Paul McMillan
    Paul found Django in 2008 while looking for a more
    structured approach to web programming. He stuck around after
    figuring out that the developers of Django had already invented
    many of the wheels he needed. His passion for breaking (and then
    fixing) things led to his current role working to maintain and
    improve the security of Django.

`Julien Phalip`_
    Julien has a background in software engineering and human-computer
    interaction. As a Web developer, he enjoys tinkering with the backend as
    much as designing and coding user interfaces. Julien discovered Django in

`Bryan Veloso`_
    Bryan found Django 0.96 through a fellow designer who was evangelizing
    its use. It was his first foray outside of the land that was PHP-based
    templating. Although he has only ever used Django for personal projects,
    it is the very reason he considers himself a designer/developer
    hybrid and is working to further design within the Django community.

    Bryan works as a designer at GitHub by day, and masquerades as a `vlogger`_
    and `shoutcaster`_ in the after-hours. Bryan lives in Los Angeles, CA, USA.

`Preston Holmes`_
    Preston is a recovering neuroscientist who originally discovered Django as
    part of a sweeping move to Python from a grab bag of half a dozen
    languages. He was drawn to Django's balance of practical batteries included
    philosophy, care and thought in code design, and strong open source
    community. Currently working for Amazon Web Services, he is always looking
    for opportunities to volunteer for community oriented education projects,
    such as for kids and scientists (e.g. Software Carpentry).

Donald Stufft
    Donald found Python and Django in 2007 while trying to find a language,
    and web framework that he really enjoyed using after many years of PHP. He
    fell in love with the beauty of Python and the way Django made tasks simple
    and easy. His contributions to Django focus primarily on ensuring that it
    is and remains a secure web framework.

`Erik Romijn`_
    Erik started using Django in the days of 1.2. His largest contribution to Django was
    ``GenericIPAddressField``, and he has worked on all sorts of patches since.
    While developing with Django, he always keeps a little list of even the slightest
    Django frustrations, to tackle them at a later time and prevent other developers
    from having to deal with the same issues.

    Erik is an independent app maker, mostly developing web and mobile apps, as
    `Solid Links`_. He also enjoys helping ordinary developers to build safer web apps,
    for which Django is already a great start, and developed `Erik's Pony Checkup`_ with

`Michael Manfre`_
    Michael started running Django on Windows against a Microsoft SQL Server
    (MSSQL) database in 2008. He quickly became the maintainer of the
    django-mssql 3rd party database backend. Much of his involvement with
    Django relates to the ORM, the private 3rd party database API, and using
    Django on Windows.

    Michael lives in Cary, NC, USA.

    .. _Michael Manfre: http://manfre.net

`Collin Anderson`_
    Collin found Django in November 2006. He was in awe of the admin and ORM
    and was amazed that the documentation was teaching him best web practices
    like redirecting after a successful POST request. Why had he never learned
    this before? No one knows to this day.

    He enjoys helping people on the |django-users| mailing list and making
    Django simple and easy for newcomers.
